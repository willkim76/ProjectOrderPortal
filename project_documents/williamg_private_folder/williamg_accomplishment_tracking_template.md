# [Your Name] - Lucas and the Willies Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:**

1) Choose team name
2) Choose project
3) Define roles and personal endpoints

**Activity:**

We chose to make an online ordering website for a restaurant. Everybody got a role and endpoints 
to work on. We did a lot of discussing the projects and ideas and getting to know each other. 

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

This was the commit for our finished design document:
https://github.com/BloomTechBackend/lucas-and-the-willies/commit/5ec1ee707274d77b603fa231f2c08629e3665e33
I opened mspaint and made very rough mockups of what our front end website would look like. 

**Things learned:**

While it's good to discuss ideas with your teammates, it's possible to go overboard and end up 
using a lot of time inefficiently. Form goals in your meetings and strive to meet those goals. 

## Week 2

**Goals:**

Start working on the endpoints we've established. 

**Activity:**

I started working on my backend endpoints along with Will. I am the git master, so it was my 
responsibility to handle version control. I learned that it was a bit of a nightmare, even on 
a project this small. I learned to use SourceTree, and also the importance of only changing the 
code that you were assigned to change. 

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

This commit was the one I had a lot of trouble with. I had to go through the differences between 
Will and my commits and choose the correct one. I definitely messed up more than once and I 
learned to appreciate version control more.

**Things learned:**

VERSION CONTROL!
Also, some basic coding practice. 

## Week 3

**Goals:**

Finish up the initial back end endpoints. We also realized that we needed a GSI, so we added 
a few new endpoints in order to satisfy the requirements. I coordinated with my teammates to 
check over our code and fix any mistakes and add functionality to it, such as checking for 
and handling exceptions. We also had to squash some bugs when testing the API and Lambdas. 

**Activity:**

Finalizing the endpoints adn squashing bugs.

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

This is the latest commit we currently have, but we're still tweaking.

https://github.com/BloomTechBackend/lucas-and-the-willies/commit/8ee071adc89daf350cf4af98c2220668e55ec9ec


**Things learned:**

There will always be bugs, no matter how much it seemed like there wouldn't be. We kept our 
project small and our endpoints bare, but there were still things I messed up. 

## Week 4

**Goals:**

**Activity:**

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:**
